AT Around Us Reflection
=================

## AT1: Voice Over with Magnifier

### What is the AT?
The AT is on iPhone. It is the use of Voice Over with Magnifier (which are accessibility features on the iPhone) to describe surroundings.

### What first person account did you find and does it meet the requirements for a first person account?
The first person account I found was of [Kristy Viers, who is blind, using these ATs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CAafjodkyE). Kristy indicates that both these accessibility technologies can be used together, and thinks its "really cool if you’re out and about or in your house and you can tell what’s around you". Kristy then demonstrates the use of it, where Kristy simply has magnifier on and goes around a park, letting it describe all the new things it sees. Kristy also indicates that on newer iPhone models, it also indicates how far you are from an object, and notes this is good for social distancing (this video was recorded about a year after the widespread outbreak of COVID-19).

### What disabilities does it support?
This supports those with low-vision or are vision impaired in any way.

### What are it’s strengths and/or weaknesses?
You have to have an iPhone to use this technology, which is a con because not everyone has one or might be able to buy one. I, for instance, have a Samsung A51, which unfortunately doesn't have this feature. The Voice Over does talk fast on Kristy's phone, which might not be good for other users and require a good amount of trouble trying to fix, even when using a screen reader. However, it does provide very accurate descriptions of Kristy's surroundings, and its very detailed at doing so. While Kristy demonstrates this AT, the Voice Over describes most or almost all features in the image, which is really cool.

### Try it Yourself
I tried this feature, but it took a bit to setup. Although Kristy described some instructions (with others being understood by Kristy's audience), the only unclear thing was how to turn on image descriptions with Voice Over, because on the iPhone I used it was not on by default. However, when I used it, I was really amazed at how well it described images of things around my house. I have to say it was really impressive!

## AT2: NLS Braille Reader

### What is the AT?
This is a braille reader that connects to a computing device and translates the on the screen into Braille.

### What first person account did you find and does it meet the requirements for a first person account?
The first person account I found was of [Kristy Viers, who is blind, using this ATs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ead9RUxtP3Q). Kristy goes into the technology, and says that Kristy likes the fact that its easy to use, and that the buttons are quite. However, Kristy notes that it cannot be used on everything, the Mac for instance. Kristy then demos the Braille Reader in use to read a book.

### What disabilities does it support?
This supports those with low-vision or are vision impaired in any way.

### What are it’s strengths and/or weaknesses?
The weakness of this technology is that it must be compatible with the computing device that someone is using. As mentioned earlier, it cannot be used with a Mac. However, it seems very easy to use. The main part of the NLS reader is a "keyboard" or mutable braille characters, and all one has to do is to run your finger across the keyboard, and then to read the next words, you just press the button at the end. So its quite intuitive!

### Try it Yourself
Unfortunately, I do not possess this reader, so I cannot try it myself

## Use of GAI
I did not use any GAI
