Website/App Report Reflection (Individual)
=======

# What was your role in writing the report? How, if at all, did you contribute to making the report accessible?

I would say I wrote a lot of the report. I made a contribution to all sections, and I would say I either wrote or revised most of the content. I made it accessible by revising the heading levels logically, and making sure the alt text was accurate. I also made sure the formatting was consistent.

# How did your contributions compare to those of your group members?

I think Colin also did well in contributing too. However, both of us did end up excluding one of our UARs since I later found they were faulty.

# When writing the report, did you read and follow class guidelines on GAI use?

I did not use GAI at all.

# Would you like to be assessed or re-assessed on any competencies? You will be assessed on your document accessibility. However, if you wish to be assessed on any additional competencies beyond the ones listed here, you need to tell us and fulfill requirements of that competency.

No, I just want to be assessed on document accessibility.
