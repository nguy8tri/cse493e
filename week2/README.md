A11yhood Analysis
=================

I chose the article [The “Deaf Tax” and Speaking for Others](https://themindhears.org/2024/07/16/the-deaf-tax-and-speaking-for-others/) by Kristin Snoddon. Kristin discusses the "Deaf Tax", which is a formal and informal practice that burdens deaf persons.

### Article Summary

Kristin speaks about the "deaf tax" within the field of sign language linguistics, but references that this practice is done in any setting. As a deaf scholar in this field, Kristin attended a conference, but asked Kristin to pay the full registration fee, even though the conference did not provide a sign language interpreter for Kristin. Kristin explains this as part of the "deaf tax" practice. Deaf people pay a "deaf tax" whenever people or society disregard them or their access needs, forcing them to overcome it.

Kristin then starts discussing the sign language linguists community, which began with mostly hearing people. Kristin then describes the experiences of 4 Deaf Linguists, who worked with hearing linguists that disregarded deaf persons views on sign language. In this setting, they paid many deaf taxes, progressing through school without assistance, putting up with their peers who questioned their expertise, and having ideas stolen from them for research.

In general, the sign language linguists community often overlooks or questions the effort of deaf linguists, upholding hearing linguists as the authority on their subject. This occurs even when hearing and deaf linguists work together. Not only does this steal the work of deaf linguists, this also prevents them from becoming experts in the field.

To change this, Kristin suggests that we as a society must change the structures and beliefs that perpetuate discrimination against the deaf. In the context of sign language linguistics, instead of doing research out of personal gain, Kristin suggests that we do so out of joy.

## Disability Justice Analysis

### Recognizing Wholeness

#### Definition

The deaf tax fails to recognize deaf people as a whole person. Recognizing wholeness involves seeing any person as a combination of many experiences, traits, and uniqueness, and not just one thing.

#### Analysis

To explain this, we will view the deaf tax in terms of the giver of it. Hearing persons who "give a deaf tax" essentially disregard the deaf person's capabilities. In the case where Kristin was not given accomodation but still expected to pay the full registration fee, the conference organizers viewed Kristin as another person in the conference, and disregarded the fact that she was deaf. In essence, they failed to consider Kristin's deafness and thus did not consider Kristin's whole person. In cases where deaf linguistics are not given proper credit, those who fail to do so essentially view deaf people only through their disability, and not as a whole person, which is the opposite situation as the first. One way to remedy the effects of this practice is for people to get to know deaf people more before judging them. This way, they get to know more of the whole person before making some arbitrary determination about them.

### Sustainability

#### Definition
The deaf tax also fails to create a sustainable future. Sustainability in this sense can only be achieved by slowing down and listening to the deaf so that we can create a society that provides consistent justice and true freedom for all.

#### Analysis
The deaf tax essentially is a way for the hearing to make progress as they believe it to be. Hearing persons will often issue a deaf tax to clear them out for their idea of progress. The organizers for the conference that Kristin wanted to attend most likely believed that it would be easier to "streamline" registration and make it the same for everyone. What is ironic is that the conference was in Kristin's field, so if anything the conference showed backwardness in Kristin's field. Not only did they fail to listen to Kristin and the deaf, they have altogether failed to sustain policies that helped them as well. We as a society can fix this issue by carefully listening to the deaf and taking the time to incorporate their needs and experiences into the products and laws we create.

### Commitment to Cross-Disability Solidarity

#### Definition
The deaf tax finally forces some level of isolation for the deaf from the rest of the community. It thus violates any commitment to cross-disability solidarity, which requires that people from all walks of life be able to freely and equally share their thoughts to influence the future.

#### Analysis
When the hearing issues a deaf tax, the actions the deaf must take to justify themselves or remedy the situation impose a certain isolation, as they are the only ones that have to pay this tax. Not only that, those that issue the tax essentially perceive the deaf as different in a way that is isolating. Using the example Kristin gave of Kristin's experience of the conference, the organizers disregarded her deafness. Whether this is intentional or not, this isolates Kristin from the rest of her peers, as they effectively have silenced her thoughts on needing a translator. However, not offering a translator is literal isolation, since as Kristin states, having no translator means she has no access to the conference. Our society can remedy the situation actively seeking out those with opinions different than those who can hear. We would then be in a position to incorporate their desires into important conversations, like ones in law-making, to make a positive impact for the future.

### Your Summary

The article I used for this assignment was [The “Deaf Tax” and Speaking for Others](https://themindhears.org/2024/07/16/the-deaf-tax-and-speaking-for-others/) by Kristin Snoddon, a deaf sign language linguistic (a person who studies the format of sign language). Kristin talks about the "Deaf Tax", which are actions that deaf people do to make up for the ignorance of hearing persons. Kristin and her peers experience it in many forms, in having to ask for translators, putting up with ignorance from their peers, being doubted on their own subject, and even having their ideas stolen from them.

When hearing people force the deaf to pay a deaf tax, a few things occur. First, it prevents hearing people from "Recognizing Wholeness", which aims to recognize people for all the experiences and traits they have. When deaf people respond to hearing persons' expectations or wrongful actions towards the deaf, hearing persons either fail to see the deaf's deafness, or they only see that they are deaf. We must fix this by carefully getting to know deaf people before prejudging them.

Secondly, the deaf tax prevents everyone from building "Sustainability", which is the principal that we must slow down and listen to everyone's experiences to build a future that gives justice for all. When hearing people try to force everyone to follow the same procedures, they become deaf to the deaf, which cause the deaf to pay a "deaf tax". We can help fix this by listening to their needs and building them into the products and laws we make.

Finally, the deaf tax prevents "cross-disability solidarity", which allows many different people to freely share their experiences to build a good future. When hearing persons impose a "deaf tax" they ignore a deaf person's needs and desires. This marks them as different and prevents their ability to participate in conversations, both of which isolate them. We should fix this by seeking out the deaf to include them in important conversations that will shape the future.
