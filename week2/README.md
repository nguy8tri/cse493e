A11yhood Analysis
=================

I chose the article [The “Deaf Tax” and Speaking for Others](https://themindhears.org/2024/07/16/the-deaf-tax-and-speaking-for-others/) by Kristin Snoddon. Kristin discusses the "Deaf Tax", which is a formal and informal practice that burdens deaf persons.

### Article Summary

Kristin speaks about the "deaf tax" within the field of sign language linguistics, but references that this practice is done in any setting. As a deaf scholar in this field, Kristin attended a conference, but asked Kristin to pay the full registration fee, even though the conference did not provide a sign language interpreter for Kristin. Kristin explains this as part of the "deaf tax" practice. Deaf people pay a "deaf tax" whenever people or society disregard them or their access needs, forcing them to overcome it.

Kristin then starts discussing the sign language linguists community, which began with mostly hearing people. Kristin then describes the experiences of 4 Deaf Linguists, who worked with hearing linguists that disregarded deaf persons views on sign language. In this setting, they paid many deaf taxes, progressing through school without assistance, putting up with their peers who questioned their expertise, and having ideas stolen from them for research.

In general, the sign language linguists community often overlooks or questions the effort of deaf linguists, upholding hearing linguists as the authority on their subject. This occurs even when hearing and deaf linguists work together. Not only does this steal the work of deaf linguists, this also prevents them from becoming experts in the field.

To change this, Kristin suggests that we as a society must change the structures and beliefs that perpetuate discrimination against the deaf. In the context of sign language linguistics, instead of doing research out of personal gain, Kristin suggests that we do so out of joy.

## Positive Disability Principles Analysis

### Is it Ableist?
This practice is quite ableist. A deaf tax essentially is a way for hearing persons to tell deaf people that they need to work harder to experience and do the same things that able persons can freely do.

### Is it Accessible?
A deaf tax is not accessible. For instance at the conference, where Kristin was not provided an interpreter, Kristen's literally paying a tax to the conference while not being able to access it is one way the deaf tax is unaccessible. A deaf tax can also be or expose non-accessibility in other scenarios, such as telling deaf people to bring their own accomodations to a public event, or by blocking them from receiving credit for an academic topic because "their disability somehow makes them unintelligent".

### Is it Disability-Led?
A deaf tax is something that hearing persons impose on the deaf, so it very much is not disability led.

### Is it being used to give control and improve agency for people with disabilities?
The deaf tax forces deaf people to fight for control and agency in their lives, so this is also untrue.

### Does it address the whole community?
No, a deaf tax in its essence is a way for hearing persons to "write off deaf people", so it effectively isolates them from the whole community.

## Disability Justice Analysis

### Recognizing Wholeness

#### Definition

The deaf tax fails to recognize deaf people as a whole person. Recognizing wholeness involves seeing any person as a combination of many experiences, traits, and uniqueness, and not just one thing.

#### Analysis

To explain this, we will view the deaf tax in terms of the giver of it. Hearing persons who "give a deaf tax" essentially disregard the deaf person's capabilities. In the case where Kristin was not given accomodation but still expected to pay the full registration fee, the conference organizers viewed Kristin as another person in the conference, and disregarded the fact that she was deaf. In essence, they failed to consider Kristin's deafness and thus did not consider Kristin's whole person. In cases where deaf linguistics are not given proper credit, those who fail to do so essentially view deaf people only through their disability, and not as a whole person, which is the opposite situation as the first. One way to remedy the effects of this practice is for people to get to know deaf people more before judging them. This way, they get to know more of the whole person before making some arbitrary determination about them.

### Sustainability

#### Definition
The deaf tax also fails to create a sustainable future. Sustainability in this sense can only be achieved by slowing down and listening to the deaf so that we can create a society that provides consistent justice and true freedom for all. This way, we can avoid burning out in helping them in the long run.

#### Analysis
The deaf tax essentially is a way for the hearing to make progress as they believe it to be. Hearing persons will often issue a deaf tax to clear them out for their idea of progress. The organizers for the conference that Kristin wanted to attend most likely believed that it would be easier to "streamline" registration and make it the same for everyone. This is unsustainable for everyone. For Kristin and Kristen's peers, they will have to keep expending energy to address this issue over and over again. For the organizers, its clear they've chosen to spend too much energy on organizing just for hearing persons, and since this is a conference, this will likely happen again. Both parties have or will suffer burnout because of these reasons, and prevents them from approaching a solution that is sustainable for everyone. In general, a deaf tax is unsustainable, because both the giver and receiver will burn out from repeatedly giving/receiving the deaf tax, and will have no energy to create real change. We must fix this by creating systemic, sustainable solutions, like creating policies to require accomodations for the deaf in all settings. This way, the deaf and hearing can spend even more time addressing other issues.

### Commitment to Cross-Disability Solidarity

#### Definition
The deaf tax finally forces some level of isolation for the deaf from the rest of the community. It thus violates any commitment to cross-disability solidarity, which requires that people from all disability backgrounds be able to freely and equally share their thoughts to influence the future.

#### Analysis
When the hearing issues a deaf tax, the actions the deaf must take to justify themselves or remedy the situation impose a certain isolation, as they are the only ones that have to pay this tax. Not only that, those that issue the tax essentially perceive the deaf as different in a way that is isolating. Using the example Kristin gave of Kristin's experience at the conference, the organizers disregarded Kristen's deafness. Whether this is intentional or not, this isolates Kristin from the rest of Kristen's peers, as they effectively have silenced Kristen's thoughts on needing a translator. However, this isolation is not just applicable to Kristin, who is deaf. This could've affected anyone with hearing-impairment, or non-verbal persons, who all require a translator. Thus, in settings where all these disabled persons are together, it would be difficult or even impossible for them to share their experiences or opinions, and will thus prevent any level of cross-disability solidarity that could've arisen. In general, the deaf tax can exclude deaf persons in any conversations with people of other disabilities, and prevents them from sharing each other's access needs and advocating for them. After all, the deaf tax in essence is probably experienced by other disabled people, who have to constantly put up with being ignored or discriminated against. We as a society should remedy this by being accomodating to the deaf so that they can work with people of other disabilities and fight for each others' access needs.

## Your Plain Language Guidelines and Summary

### Which plain language guidelines should we look for in your summary?
The four guidelines I'm focusing on are using simple words, short sentences, short paragraphs, and transition words.

### Your Summary

The article I used for this assignment was [The “Deaf Tax” and Speaking for Others](https://themindhears.org/2024/07/16/the-deaf-tax-and-speaking-for-others/). It is by Kristin Snoddon, a deaf sign language linguistic (a person who studies sign language's format). Kristin talks about the "Deaf Tax", which deaf people "pay when hearing persons are ignorant of their access need. A deaf tax can be as simple as asking for translators. It can be as bad as being discriminated against. Unfortunately, what's common is that deaf experience it frequently.

A deaf tax will usually cause a few things. First, it prevents hearing people from "recognizing wholeness", or seeing deaf people as a complete person. When hearing persons act unjustly towards the deaf, hearing persons fail to recognize their needs, or set them apart because they are deaf. We must fix this by carefully getting to know deaf people before judging them.

Secondly, the deaf tax prevents everyone from being sustainable. Being sustainable means slowly listening to the disabled, and slowly making changes to society to create lasting benefits for them. The deaf tax at best makes short-term fixes for deaf people. The deaf and hearing must then repeat the deaf tax, which causes them to burn out. As a result, they have no energy left to create a systemic change to help deaf persons. We can fix this by slowing down to make changes to society, like requiring hearing-impairment accomodations.

Finally, the deaf tax prevents "cross-disability solidarity". This is when people of different disabilities unite to fight for each others' needs. When hearing persons impose a "deaf tax", they silence a deaf person's needs and opinions. This prevents them from sharing their experience with other disabled people with the same and different access needs. This is unfortunate, as the latter often experiences the same injustices that the deaf tax causes. Thus, there is no cross-disability solidarity for the deaf whenever they pay deaf taxes. We must fix this by listening to their access needs and providing for them. This will allow them to unite with people with other disabilities to create positive change for them all.
